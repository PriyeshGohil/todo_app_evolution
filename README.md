# todo_app_evolution

the idea for this project is to start with a basic implementation of a todo app and slowly built up on it

### Enhancement ideas / random thoughts
* Add a database (thinking firebase)
* try out different JS frameworks (vuejs & reactjs) to see if they help improve the JS code
* Make todos more advance, currently only useful info about todo is the title :(
* Image upload support
